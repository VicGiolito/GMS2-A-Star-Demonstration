Lower blue numbers in each cell represent the terrain costs for that cell.

Upper magenta numbers represent the 'step' values of our A Star algorithm as it moves through the grid.

Use lmb click to set your initial start cell. The program will immediately run my variant of A Star algorithm each time the mouse cursor moves to a different cell. The dark cells are the inaccessible 'wall' cells
that we avoid. Experiment with this and you can see how the pather generally avoids pathing through the higher terrain cost areas like mountains and swamps (red and brown), and likes to use the low cost areas 
like the roads (gray) whenever possible.

You can reset your start coordinates with a rmb click.

Press the enter key and you can even send a little player object along the route you created with A Star.
